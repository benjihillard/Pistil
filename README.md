# Pistil Magazine

Pistil Magazine was created as an open forum and literary platform for women of all ages who want to explore the world beyond the social constructs. A place in which you can learn about who you truly are by expanding your mind and reading raw unfiltered experiences of the strong women around you. A space of no judgment or competitiveness but complete empathy and unconditional love. To support the growth of women in their lives and the difference they will make in the future.


Pistil started out as building a simple e-zine for my sister, But soon became a challenge to build a e-zine publication platform with two goals. The first  being to make a UX that is simple and intuitive enough that anyone can manage their own magazine brand online. With the second being make the code versatile enough where anyone with basic css knowledge could easily customize the platform to their own needs by simply changing some images and css properties. The pistil platform host article from a mongodb database, And dynamically generates web articles with as little as a text document, image and a title. Watch the demo to find out more.
